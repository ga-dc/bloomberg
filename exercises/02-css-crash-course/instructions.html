<p>(Once you&#39;ve had an intro to Git and Github, these steps will no longer be necessary.)</p>
<p>Click the &quot;Download ZIP&quot; button toward the top-right of this page. This will download a <code>.zip</code> file to your Desktop (or your &quot;Documents&quot; folder, or your &quot;Downloads&quot; folder, depending on how your computer&#39;s set up).</p>
<p>It may automatically &quot;expand&quot; and turn into a folder with the same name. If it doesn&#39;t, double-click on the <code>.zip</code> file, or right-click on it and select &quot;Expand&quot;.</p>
<p>Move the expanded folder into your <code>wdi</code> folder to keep everything organized.</p>
<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Provided are a bunch of <code>.md</code> files, and a bunch of <code>.css</code> files.</p>
<p>The <code>.css</code> files contain a bunch of CSS snippets. The <code>.md</code> files contain English descriptions of what all those CSS snippets do -- but in a different order.</p>
<p>Your job is to copy each CSS snippet and paste it next to its description in one of the <code>.md</code> files.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>A CSS snippet:</p>
<pre><code>background-color:red;
</code></pre><p>An <code>.md</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>Gives el a red background
` ` `
.el{

}
` ` `
</code></pre><p>...and the solution in the <code>.md</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>Gives el a red background
` ` `
.el{
  background-color:red;
}
` ` `
</code></pre><h2 id="to-solve-this-">To solve this...</h2>
<p>First, look at the words used in the CSS snippets. What do the words mean in English? For instance, if you see <code>background-color:red</code>, it&#39;s pretty obvious what that does.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re not sure about a particular snippet, put it in the provided <code>index.html</code> and see how its appearance is affected.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the provided <code>index.html</code> file in your web browser. (Drag and drop the file onto the icon of a web browser on your computer.)</li>
<li>Copy and paste the snippet into the section marked <code>PUT YOUR CSS HERE</code>.</li>
<li>&quot;Save&quot; the <code>index.html</code> file.</li>
<li>&quot;Refresh&quot; the page in your browser to see what changes have been applied.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you&#39;re still unsure, try Googling the name of the CSS property in question (e.g. &quot;CSS background-color&quot;).</p>
<h2 id="what-is-el-">What is &quot;el&quot;?</h2>
<p>&quot;El&quot; is short for &quot;element&quot;. Often, &quot;el&quot; is used in Javascript to refer to a certain element. In this case, when you&#39;re told to &quot;do something with el,&quot; it means &quot;do something with all elements with the class of &#39;el&#39;&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="hint">Hint</h2>
<p>If you&#39;ve copied and pasted some strange CSS and refreshed the page, but it doesn&#39;t look any different, the CSS may only affect its appearance when the screen or particular elements are bigger or smaller than a certain size. </p>
