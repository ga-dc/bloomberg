#### PART 1:

Take the fixed layout and convert it entirely to a flexible layout, i.e. one that expands and contracts depending on the browser window. This will require converting the various containers from absolute (pixel) units to percentages.

Remember that when you declare a value as a percentage in CSS, it is *always* relative to its container. In other words, if you've written #outerdiv {width:1200px;} and #innerdiv {width:50%};, then #innerdiv will be rendered as 600px wide in the browser.

First, change find the width declaration for #wrap and change it to max-width:1200px;

Then, using the outline below as a scratchpad, change all widths and *horizontal* margins/paddings to percentages. Vertical measurements (heights, top and bottom margins and padding, etc), can be left in pixels.


    body

	 #wrap (width = 1200px)
	 
	    #main 
	    [content]      
	    /main 
	 
	    #side
	 
		  #bio
		   [content]    
		  /bio
	 
		  #further
		  [content]
		  /further
	 
	     /side
	  
	 /wrap

    /body

#### PART 2: 

You now have a flexible layout that adapts to the width of a browser. Even so, it becomes hard to read at the skinnier dimensions. We'll fix this with media queries.


##### A
    Beginning with #wrap, put all of your css into this media query. 
    This applies your rules only when the browser is over 801px wide.

    [ global styles are up here ]

    /*Begin 3-column layout*/
    @media screen and (min-width: 801px) {

	    [ all the main except for the global styles goes here ]

    } /*end three-column layout */


##### B

Now tack an additional media query to the end of your stylesheet. 
This applies a different set of rules when the browser is between 600px and 800px wide.


    /* Begin medium, two-column layout */

    @media screen and (min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 800px) {
	    a {color:#407f90;} /*blue*/
	    #wrap {padding:20px; }
	    #main {width:65%; float:left;}
	    #side {width:30%; float:right;}	
	    #main, #side {border-top:10px solid #407f90;}
    } 
    /* end two-column layout*/


##### C

Now put in one final media query at the end of your stylesheet. 
This applies your rules another set of rules when the browser is 
between less than 600px wide: iphones, for example.

    /* Begin single-column layout */

    @media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
	    a {color:#604090;} /*purple*/
	    #wrap {padding:10px;}
	    #main, #side {border-top:10px solid #604090;}
    } 
    /* End single-column layout*/

### Tables revisited

#### Make it fluid-width

```
width:100%;
table-layout:fixed;
overflow:hidden;
```

#### Hide the unimportant stuff

```
th:nth-child(2),
td:nth-child(2),
th:nth-child(4),
td:nth-child(4),
th:nth-child(5),
td:nth-child(5){
  display:none;
}
```

#### Reformat the table using pseudo-elements

```
td:nth-child(1):before{
  content:'Title: '
}
```

### Table based layouts

Last time, we talked about how table-based layout is **bad**

- Difficult to maintain
- Non-semantic
- Tightly coupled

#### Two Column Layout

#### Two Column With Header

#### Two Column With Header & Footer

### Inline Styles

Because the `&lt;link>` and `&lt;head>` are unsupported in Gmail, many providers
will add inline styles to each element

<a href='./exercises/07-inline-styles/linkedin.html' class='button'>View LinkedIn example</a>

This would be near-impossible to do by hand. Fortunately, there are tools out
there that will do this for us.

<http://templates.mailchimp.com/resources/inline-css/>
<http://foundation.zurb.com/emails/inliner.html>

Unfortunately, these tools are not 100% reliable, and require manual work.

### Use a template

Zurbâ€™s foundation is a front-end framework that offers solutions to many
common problems in front-end web development

>A front-end Framework is a collection of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript containing design patterns that you can build upon. They keep you from wasting time rewriting boring, boilerplate code over and over again. In addition to saving time, they actually help you write better code. Sites built on Foundation work great on multiple devices including desktop and laptop computers, tablets, and mobile phones because it is a responsive framework that uses CSS media queries and a mobile-first approach. Designers can create unique designs for a variety of screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience no matter the device.

By using an open source framework, we can rely on code that has been tested by 
tens of thousands of users.
